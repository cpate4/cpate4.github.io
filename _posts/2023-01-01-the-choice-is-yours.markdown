There is so much to write about.
And honestly, I don't even know where to start.

I am choosing to set out on a much deliberate path to reach my goals than in years past.
And in doing so, I am choosing to focus on the systems and habits that support the desired behaviors I wish to embody to help me realize those goals.

I am making a commitment to myself of at least 10 minutes a day to do this.

Write to no one and everyone.

Getting my thoughts out on paper.
It doesn't have to be perfect, but it is something.
Because regardless of whether I am walking, rucking, running, or just taking a moment to sit,
I am told that my brain hardly ever stops and it can be a blessing or a curse depending on your perspective.

This writing process is going to go like this.  
Blank screen.  
Start a clock.  
Write for at least 10 minutes.  
If I am done at 10, great.  
If I have more to say, cap it at 20.

When this is done, reread what I wrote.  
Give it a title.  
Hit save, and push the changes.

Welcome to what I think about.
