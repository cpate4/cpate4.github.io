The timer has started.
Today was a good day, and I am grateful.

I really enjoyed spending time with my son.
I know things haven't been easy for him, for one reason or another.
And in spite of everything, Gavin keeps pushing.
I have had some great conversations with him over the last 24 hours, and
for the first time in a long while I see him wanting to genuinely do something for himself.

I also enjoyed the fact I was able to make it outside for another walk.
There are parts of me that want to be more "active", but I am actively choose to not focus on that.
I am principally focused on being grateful for "what is" versus "what could be" or "what I think should be".
I find that it is all too easy to succumb to negative thinking and general perspective.
With that in mind, while I was on my walk today, I stayed focused on being happy.

Finding that smile.

The hip wasn't working quite like I wanted it to, but the smile and wave was present.
Only I could control my perspective on things.

I was breathing.  
I was alive.  
I was being active.

And that is all that mattered to me.

This is two days into a new set of behaviors. Not goals. Behaviors.
I am interested to see how this works and stacks up over the long haul.

1% improvements.
I feel like I can sign off for the day today knowing that there were a lot of things accomplished,
and in the end, and overall, well beyond 1% improvement across a lot of categories.

There is a lot you can get out of your head in 10 minutes.
